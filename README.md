My project is an e-commerce application called "Elo", designed for a clothing brand. The application, built in Android Studio using Kotlin, is still in development, and I have so far implemented 7 key screens. These screens focus on providing a foundation for the shopping experience, with some features and layouts functional, while others are yet to be completed.
What I Have Implemented So Far:

    Main Home Screen:
        The home screen features a clean layout that displays promotional banners and featured collections for men's and women's clothing. The layout uses ConstraintLayout to ensure responsiveness across devices.
        The top bar includes a hamburger menu for navigation, a centered logo, and a cart icon, which aligns with the brand’s minimalist and modern design.

    Search Screen:
        I have implemented a search bar that allows users to type in queries to look for products, although the search results feature is not fully functional yet. The layout is in place, and it visually integrates well with the top bar.

    Product Details Screen:
        A product details page where users can view more information about specific items, including images, descriptions, and prices. This page displays basic product information but is not yet linked to dynamic data.

    Cart Screen:
        The cart screen allows users to view items they intend to purchase. I’ve designed the layout with item previews, pricing, and a "proceed to checkout" button, though the checkout functionality is yet to be developed.

    Bottom Navigation:
        The bottom navigation bar has been implemented to provide quick access to different sections of the app like Home, Search, Profile, Cart, and More. It works smoothly for navigation between the implemented screens.

    Profile Screen:
        A basic profile screen where users will be able to view their account information and manage their preferences. Currently, the layout is in place, but user data integration is still pending.

    Category Browsing:
        There is a screen where users can browse categories such as men's and women's clothing. This screen serves as a bridge between the home page and specific product details but doesn’t yet feature sorting or filtering options.

Current Progress and What’s Missing:

    UI Design: The user interface design for the implemented screens is mostly complete, with emphasis on clean layouts and consistent branding. However, the visual flow between screens needs refinement, and some elements like dynamic product listings and filters are yet to be incorporated.

    Functionality: The core navigation between screens is functional, but several features such as search results, product filtering, and checkout workflows remain incomplete. Most screens are static and do not yet interact with a backend or real-time data.

    Next Steps: My next steps include integrating dynamic data, completing the search and cart functionalities, and enhancing the user experience with animations and additional features like category filtering, user authentication, and payments.
